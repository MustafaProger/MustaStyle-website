# ⌚️ MustaStyle Website

This project is a front-end website developed as a college assignment. The main objectives were to practice and demonstrate skills in modern web development, specifically using Gulp for task automation and PHPMailer for integrating email functionality.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structured the content of the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styled the website with advanced features such as Flexbox, Grid, and animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Added dynamic content and interactivity.
- **Gulp**: Automated tasks like compiling, minifying CSS and JS, and live reloading during development.
- **Sass**: Preprocessor used for writing cleaner, more maintainable CSS.
- **PHPMailer**: Integrated for handling email sending functionality via PHP.

## 🚀 Purpose

This project was developed as part of a college assignment to enhance my front-end development skills. It provided an opportunity to practice using Gulp for streamlining the development process and to experiment with integrating PHPMailer for email functionality.

## 🌐 Live Demo

**Note:** The website may not fully function if hosted on GitHub Pages because GitHub Pages does not support PHP or server-side technologies required for email functionality with PHPMailer.

## 💡 Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works well on devices of all sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes interactive features such as buttons, sliders, and modals.
- **Email Integration**: Implemented email sending functionality using PHPMailer.
